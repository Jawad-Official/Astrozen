# Feature Window terminology and Agent Plan Update

I have updated the Feature Window and Agent Plan components.

## Changes:

1.  **Terminology**: Renamed "Mission Domain" to **"Project"** in `FeatureWindow.tsx`.
2.  **Button Removal**: Removed the "Create Issue" button from individual task items in `agent-plan.tsx`.
