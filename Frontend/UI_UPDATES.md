# Features of the UI Updates

I have completed the requested changes:

1.  **"Mission Domain" is now "Project"**.
2.  **"Create Issue" button is removed** from the roadmap items.
3.  **"Problem Statement" is now "Description"**.
4.  **"Execution Roadmap" is now just "Roadmap"**.
5.  **"Decommission" is now "Delete Feature"**.

The interface is cleaner and simpler.
